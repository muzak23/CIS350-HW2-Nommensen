# Logan Nommensen

* I enjoy working with servers and coding projects.
* I have been in band since 5th grade, and currently play the french horn in GVSU's Concert Band and the mellophone in the Laker Marching Band.
* I like playing games like Minecraft, Binding of Isaac, Valorant (competitive FPS), and FTL: Faster Than Light (rogue-like).

## Technical Background
I have experience coding in Java and Python. I also have server administration experience.

In Java I have coded several class projects, including a minimax chess AI for a chess project. Outside of class I have published two open-source Minecraft server plugins, though the code is abhorrent as I wrote them when I was first learning to code.

In Python I have developed a Discord bot with multiple functions and games, as well as several smaller data processing programs to visualize various API's data in more interesting ways.

I rented a dedicated server running Ubuntu and hosted multiple game servers on it as well as a website. The server management was interesting to me and I currently also have a personal VPS I'm renting to use for personal projects.
